## 1. Introduction
This repo contains the Unity simulation for hospital scenario provided by WPI HiRO Lab [Gopher-In-Unity-Simulation](https://github.com/hiro-wpi/Gopher-In-Unity-Simulation) and a freight social robot that can understand human speech and also talk back to humans. The robots main functionality is to understand human speech containing navigation commands, derive human intent from speech like go to which room, go to which person, etc and then execute the following command. More information about working and can be found here #TODO: add link.

## 2. Setup
In order to setup the repo follow the instruction in [SETUP.md](https://github.com/dennyboby/social_robot_navigation/blob/master/SETUP.md).

## 3. Run
This section discusses the setup of parameters and running different launch files.

Since the NLP model is developed using Picovoice, the Access Key could be expired and you might be required to create a new account or purchase a plan to work with the model in the future. At the time of writing this documentation,there might be a few days left for Access Key validity, but fret not as we have also included the model's YAML file, all you need to do is create another account on Picovoice and import the YAML file.
